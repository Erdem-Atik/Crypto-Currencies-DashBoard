       # CryptoCurrenciesDashBoard-10of30days
     
This project is very basic a crypto currency dashboard. You can see the USD equivalent of many #crypto currencies on the app.
Built by html, css, and vanilla JS. I didn't designed and code this app for professional purposes; I just wanted to make an app with async functions.

This app was maken to improve my JS skills and give some original design inspiration to newbie dev guys :)
I thought the newbies might be bored with the beginner project ideas; to-do, calculator etc. Developing 'Cryptocurrency Dashboard' can be fun. 

By the way, thanks CurrencyFreaks for great API(you can find them and other alternatives on https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#cryptocurrency); I used their API to get crypto info.
All the best!

PS: I am exactly open to new ideea to develop/refactoring
